\subsection*{Summary}

A digital clock using the A\+VR A\+T\+Mega16 (or A\+T\+Mega32) and D\+S-\/1307 R\+TC that is set using a U\+A\+RT connection to computer, the time is got and sent using a G\+UI application. You can also set and clear an alarm using the G\+UI application.

\subsection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Display current time and date including day of the week.
\item Alarm functionality, and keeping the alarm in internal E\+E\+P\+R\+OM.
\item Display a message that an alarm is set, even if the system is reset before the alarm event takes place.
\item When an alarm event happens, a pin is toggled for a minute. Then the alarm notification disappears from the L\+CD.
\item Stopwatch functionality, controlled by G\+UI or physical button connected to external interrupt pin.
\item Set current current time, date and alarm via G\+UI application.
\item Get temperature of a city (name in python code) from the web, and send it to M\+CU.
\item Clear L\+CD screen with G\+UI.
\item G\+UI is working on both Linux and Windows.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Notice}

The packages {\ttfamily python3-\/tk}, {\ttfamily pyserial} should be installed. tk is used to make the G\+UI and pyserial is used for U\+A\+RT communication by the G\+UI app.

\subsection*{How to compile?}

Just put the files of the project in one folder/directory, and then run {\ttfamily make build} from the command line.

Assuming avr-\/dude is installed on your system, you can run {\ttfamily make load} to load the program into the M\+CU.

\subsection*{Todo}

Adding cycling of baudrate via external interrupt

\subsection*{Project status}

Having problems with sending alarm and temperature values to microcontroller. The transmission is broken or L\+CD doesn\textquotesingle{}t update.

Update\+: Never mind, it was a wiring issue!
